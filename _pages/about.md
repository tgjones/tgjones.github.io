I'm Tim Jones, a software developer living in Taipei, Taiwan with my wife and son.

I have been developing software for over 15 years, mostly in .NET / C#. I've also worked with Ruby, Objective-C, Swift, F#, and C++. I am fascinated by 3D graphics, usually in the form of Direct3D and HLSL (and XNA, back in the day).

I've written [quite a lot of open source code](https://github.com/tgjones). Currently I work on
[HLSL Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TimGJones.HLSLToolsforVisualStudio), a Visual Studio
extension that brings IntelliSense to HLSL shaders.

By day I'm proud to work for [Smartbox](https://thinksmartbox.com), building Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) software.
