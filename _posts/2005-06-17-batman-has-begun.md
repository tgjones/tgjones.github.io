I went to see Batman Begins last night.

What can I say - but **wow**! It's as pure a piece of entertainment as I've ever seen. Come to think of it, I'm not sure how it could have been more entertaining.

It's also the first film I've seen at the cinema where the audience spontaneously applauded at the end.

Moral of the story: see the film!
