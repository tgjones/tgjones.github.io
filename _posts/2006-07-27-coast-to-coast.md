A couple of weeks ago, I spent two weeks walking from the west coast of England to the east coast. This was the most exhilerating, most beautiful, most challenging walk I've yet done. The scenery was truly superlative and I met some of the friendliest people I've ever come into contact with.

I took 9 hours of video footage, which I'm now trying to edit down to a more reasonable 45 minutes, in a documentary style. Has anybody else tries this? I've spent a week so far, and I've got 3 minutes of edited video out of it - at this rate, expect to see the film in 2024.
