I got to thinking today, if I still had an original, wrapped Marathon bar, from the days before the [Snickers](http://www.ciao.co.uk/Reviews/Snickers__5308867) fiasco, would I buy be able to sell it on Ebay for millions of pounds? Well, okay, maybe not millions. But there's got to be somebody out there who collects such things.

While I'm on the topic, maybe I should have kept hold of some Opal Fruits and [Mr Dog](http://www.ciao.co.uk/Cesar__74765) as well.

Work continues on the C2C video (still editing the footage from day 1 out of 12)...
