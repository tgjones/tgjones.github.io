Before I start a religious discussion about the whys and wherefores of whether you should build your own blog engine, I'd like to say that that is not what I'm writing about. Other, worthier, people have already covered that:

* Phil Haacked - [Rolling Your Own Blog Engine](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/10/06/Rolling_Your_Own_Blog_Engine.aspx)
* Rob Conery - [Be A Good Jedi: Build Your Own Blog](http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/be-a-good-jedi-build-your-own-blog)
* Tom Walsham - [On Rolling Your Own Blog Engine](http://www.tomwalsham.com/2010/08/27/on-rolling-your-own-blog-engine/)

So what am I hoping to contribute with this series of posts? Assuming you *have* decided to build your own blog engine, I would like to cover some of the more interesting implementation details. The kind of things that often get left out, but make the difference between a "functional" blog and, well, a much better one.
