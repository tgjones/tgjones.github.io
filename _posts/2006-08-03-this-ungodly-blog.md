Have you ever heard the word ungodly used as an adjective for anything other than "hour"? According to [dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ungodly), the definition of ungodly is:

* Not revering God; impious.
* Sinful; wicked.
* Outrageous: *had to leave for work at an ungodly hour*.

Personally, I've only ever heard it used in the third way.
