Another post, another gig! This time it was the Flaming Lips - and they seemingly spared no expense to put on a great show. Psychedelic lighting, thousands of balloons, and shirt-vibrating volume were the main ingredients, which worked well with their slightly oddball music. I thoroughly enjoyed it, if only because I got to play with exceedingly large balloons.
