This is the same project I [mentioned in my last post](/blog/archive/2010/11/20/xna-model-viewer-inside-visual-studio). It's quite fun to work on so I've done a little bit more to it since then.

I'm going to call it "XNA Inspector", since it was partially inspired by the inspector panel in Unity3D. It's a Visual Studio 2010 extension which allows models and textures (and shortly effects) from XNA Content Projects to be previewed in a tool window. It's very much in development, but when it's finished it will be open source, and available through Visual Studio Extension Manager.

Here's a sneak peek of it in action:

I'm not sure when it will be finished - not for a couple of weeks at least, but I'll post updates here as I go.
