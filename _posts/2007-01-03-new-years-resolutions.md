My new year's resolution: 1280 x 1024.

Sorry.

Although I agree with those who say that making resolutions at the beginning of a new year is a pointless activity - because if something's worth doing at the beginning of a year then it's worth doing all the time - I find it's a useful crutch.

Here's some of mine:

* Learn to play the oboe. I have a dream of sitting at the top of a mountain, guru-like, playing comforting melodies on the oboe to weary travellers. I shall call myself Sage Tim The Cold And Not That Wise.
* Expand my repertoire of recipes. There's thousands of different ingredients available in the average supermarket, and a number several orders of magnitude higher ways of combining those ingredients. And I know how to cook, oh, about 6 different dinners.
* Cycle to work. I've been promising this one to myself and others for a year now, but this time I'm, uhmm, slightly more serious.
* Enter some local 5k and 10k runs. I loved running these distances when preparing for the Nike 10k run in October, and I'd like to do some more competitive running, especially at the 5k distance, primarily because it's over nice and quickly.
