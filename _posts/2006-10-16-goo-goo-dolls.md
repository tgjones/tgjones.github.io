Just come back from the Goo Goo Dolls gig at the Shepherd's Bush Empire. Man do they rock! I've been to some good gigs before by some great bands, but I think this has to be my favourite gig so far.

They played a lot of the old favourites - Slide, Broadway, Name; and some of the newer songs: Tucked Away, Smash, Stay With You (the opener), Let Love In. However, when they strummed the first few chords of Iris the crowd went absolutely wild - great stuff.

The encore was Become, a beautiful song that ends their most recent album, and then Give a Little Bit - probably my favourite song on Let Love In.

Altogether a fun evening - I really should go to gigs more often.
