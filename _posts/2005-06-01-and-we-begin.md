After previous abortive attempts at getting a regular blog going (including a protracted design and build of my own personal blogging software, which I didn't quite finish) I have decided the best way to get started is to do it the easy way - use somebody else's blogging site.

So here we are. Hello! I plan to use this blog to tell the world about my interests, my job, my snippets of wisdom (yeah right), and my various projects.

My current project is writing a 3D car simulator, so I'll be blogging more about that in the next few weeks.
