This is my first attempt at solving the "cracks" problem of geomipmapping. Please bear in mind that I've just been coding for the whole evening without actually running it...

I'll be putting up a dedicated website for Torq2 soon, with pages explaining how it all works, including a description of how I'm implementing geomipmapping, in case it's useful for anybody.

I know there's a lot of tutorials out there about it, but I've found that very few of them actually get down to the nitty gritty - such as how to work out the indices for patches when joining them to neighbouring patches of different LOD...
