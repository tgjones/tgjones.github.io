<div style="clear:both;"></div>It seems that when you have your mobile phone in a carrier bag, and that carrier bag is being used as a base marker in a game of rounders, and one of the players (mentioning no names, Dene) descends with some speed onto the carrier bag, your mobile phone may not survive intact.

I thought at first the whole phone was broken, but it turned out that it was fully functioning except for the rather unhealthy looking screen. So without further ado, I bought a replacement LCD screen from a Hong Kong seller on eBay for £7.49 (plus a rather hefty delivery charge of £10). Impressively, it arrived today, only 4 days after I ordered it.

The only thing that wasn't included in the package was a set of instructions. So I've just spent the last hour pulling my phone apart, fitting the new screen, and then doing a lot of hoping that it would work when I reassembled everything.

After putting it back together, I'm happy to say it works!
