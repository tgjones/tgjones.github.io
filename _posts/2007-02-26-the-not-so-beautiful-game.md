This is from a leaflet I was handed by one of those people on the street who you desperately try to avoid - in this case, I tried the "buffer person" and "ground scanning" tactics - but somehow they outwit you and you end up holding a piece of paper with some odd words written on it.

For example:
<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Wywrr60_Hxc/ReM05-y0yoI/AAAAAAAAABE/PWPXDCmccmc/s1600-h/Image.jpg"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Wywrr60_Hxc/ReM05-y0yoI/AAAAAAAAABE/PWPXDCmccmc/s400/Image.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5035926979043707522" border="0" /></a>

What I'm wondering is, if Jesus is the referee, and the world is the pitch... can I be the streaker? And what does Jesus think of dives and reckless tackling?

On second thoughts... I don't wish to be red-carded so I'll stop now.
