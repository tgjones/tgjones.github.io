<div style="clear:both;"></div>My little Peugeot 106 has now travelled 100000 miles since it was manufactured (or since the odometer got reset by a dodgy dealer, but I don't like to be accusatory on my blog). I believe this is the traditional point at which it requires a new cylinder head gasket, or a new engine, or something like that. Anyway, I caught the whole exciting event on my mobile phone's camera - I'm not completely sure of the legality of using a camera while heading down the A3 at 50mph, so if there's any police reading this, my real name is definitely not Tim Jones.
