<a href="http://environment.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn11417&amp;feedId=online-news_rss20">This New Scientist article</a> indicates that some "fudging" of climate science may have been systematically occurring over the last 10 years. The guy who seems to have been responsible, Phil Cooney, used to be a lobbyist for the American Petroleum Institute, and he has since gone on to ExxonMobil. In other words, exactly the kind of person we want influencing the policy of the global hegemon on climate change.

While I'm complaining about other people / entities doing their best to destroy the world, allow me to mention Shell - this year's sponsor of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition. <a href="http://www.foe.co.uk/index.html">Friends of the Earth</a> has an interesting set of photos highlighting their more accurate role as <a href="http://www.foe.co.uk/campaigns/corporates/news/shell_wildlife_gallery.html">Shell: Wildlife Destroyer of the Year</a>.

Okay, enough green politics. I don't know what I'm talking about anyway.
