To make it a bit easier to get started with [DotLiquid](http://dotliquidmarkup.org/), I have [created](http://nupackpackages.codeplex.com/) a [NuGet](http://nuget.codeplex.com/) package for it. This is now in the official NuGet package repository. Just search for DotLiquid, click "Install", and you should be good to go.

While this initial version should be fairly stable, we are still actively developing DotLiquid, and I'll be updating the NuGet package as we go.
