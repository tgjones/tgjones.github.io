<div style="clear:both;"></div>So, it turns out the iTunes COM API is incredibly simple to use - even with C#. It's only taken me half an hour to write a little app that grabs the selected track from iTunes, searches a lyrics website to grab the lyrics, and adds the lyrics to the track info in iTunes.

Here's a screenie:
<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3747/1168/1600/iLyrics.0.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3747/1168/400/iLyrics.0.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>

At the moment it's really basic - it will only work for one track. But it will be easy enough to make it work for any number of selected tracks.

Let me know if you're interested - I'm quite willing to publish the source and binaries.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>
