Woo, coloured squares! I'm changing direction slightly for Torq2. I'm starting from scratch, which if you know me, you'll know is something I like to do quite frequently. I did have a terrain implemented using geomipmapping, but I'm changing to the new and shiny geometry clipmapping algorithm. I've been working on it for 2 hours so far and all I've got to show for it is coloured squares:

I'm implementing geometry clipmapping (hereafter geoclipmapping) from the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/%7Ehoppe/geomclipmap.pdf">Asirvatham / Hoppe</a> paper, and I'm planning to blog about any obstacles I come across and hopefully overcome.
