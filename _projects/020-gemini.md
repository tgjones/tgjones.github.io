Gemini is a WPF framework that allows you to create IDE-like applications. It includes a number of modules that provide useful out-of-the-box functionality: CodeCompiler, CodeEditor, ErrorList, GraphEditor, Inspector, Inspector.Xna, Output, PropertyGrid and Xna.

I use it in a number of my own [projects](/projects).
