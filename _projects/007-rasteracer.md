Hybrid Ray Tracing / XNA renderer which I originally blogged about [here](/blog/archive/2008/05/15/xna-hybrid-ray-tracer). Very simple implementation, more a proof of concept than anything useful. It renders XNA into a WinForms control, and switches to ray tracing if you leave the mouse stationary.
