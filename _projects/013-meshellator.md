Back when Silverlight was having its heyday, it seemed like a good idea to write a fully managed 3D asset import library. Meshellator supports importing of Autodesk 3DS and Lightwave OBJ files. Because of the demise of Silverlight, and because [Assimp.NET](https://code.google.com/p/assimp-net/) exists, I'm not planning to develop Meshellator further.
