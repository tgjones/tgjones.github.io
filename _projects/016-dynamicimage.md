DynamicImage is a high-performance image manipulation library for ASP.NET. This isn't really my project - it was created by [Sound in Theory](http://www.soundintheory.co.uk/). In my own fork, I've been steadily moving it forwards, to the point where I think it's a great choice for ASP.NET image manipulation, especially if you need more complex layering or combination of filters.
